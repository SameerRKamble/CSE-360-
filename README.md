This is a back-end system for a pediatric office. It is designed to be used by doctors, nurses, and patients. 


When a patient arrives, an office staff nurse will record their information and vitals in the system. After a patient has been checked in, a file will be created for them.

Once the patient has been examined by a doctor, the doctor will be able to enter their findings into the system, which will then be stored in the patient's file. The doctor will be able to prescribe medications, which the system will send directly to the pharmacy listed in the patient's records. 

After a patient has had a visit, they'll be able to view the results of their visit through the patient portal. They'll also be able to send messages directly to healthcare staff through the integrated messaging system.
